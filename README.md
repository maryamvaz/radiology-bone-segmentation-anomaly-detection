# radiology-bone-segmentation-anomaly-detection
<strong> 2020 MU senior design project: Bone segmentation and anomaly detection in knee plain radiographs. </strong> 

We will be developing and utilizing deep learning computer vision strategies to tackle the problem. To feed the data hungry deep learning methods, we will be working on a publicly and freely knee radiographic dataset, namely [The Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI)](https://nda.nih.gov/oai/). 


## Step (1): Data Pulling
Dataset: [The Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI)](https://nda.nih.gov/oai/). 

Image modality: X-rays. 


## Step (2): Building a fully-annotated image segmentation dataset
<p align="justify"> 
There is a plenty of software tool sets that are facilitating the construction of fully-annotated image segmentation dataset(s). We are focusing on the following toolset, examining their quality attributes to see which one(s) provide better functionalities with relative ease and speed: 
     
<strong>[1]</strong> [PixelAnnotationTool](https://github.com/abreheret/PixelAnnotationTool). 
<strong>[2]</strong> [CVAT](https://github.com/opencv/cvat/blob/develop/cvat/apps/documentation/installation.md#ubuntu-1804-x86_64amd64).
<strong>[3]</strong> [scalabel](https://github.com/scalabel/scalabel).
