# radiology-bone-segmentation-anomaly-detection
<strong> 2020 MU senior design project: Bone segmentation and anomaly detection in knee plain radiographs. </strong> 

We will be developing and utilizing deep learning computer vision strategies to tackle the problem. To feed the data hungry deep learning methods, we will be working on a publicly and freely knee radiographic dataset, namely [The Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI)](https://nda.nih.gov/oai/). 


## Step (1): Data Pulling:
[The Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI)](https://nda.nih.gov/oai/). 

Image modality: X-rays. 


## Building a fully-annotated image segmentation dataset
<p align="justify"> 
There is a plenty of software tool sets that are facilitating the construction of fully-annotated image segmentation dataset(s). We are focusing on the following toolset, examining their quality attributes to which one(s) provide better functionalities with relative ease and speed:
